# Tic-Tac-Toe
A very basic, minimalist, Tic-Tac-Toe game with an unbeatable hard AI.

Game available at : https://nichathan.itch.io/nichathans-tic-tac-toe
Created with Unity

2 Playing types :
  player versus player
  player versus computer

3 player versus computer difficulties :
  Easy - Enemy chooses a random location on the board
  Medium - If the Enemy sees a string of 2 on the board, it will add a mark to the end, otherwise follow Easy. (It should cap it's own first.)
  Hard - The first 2 moves are scripted. Then, if the Enemy sees that a trap can be set, it will set it, otherwise, follow Medium.
  
Game is available as :
  Windows Installer - This has not been stress tested to see the minimum Windows version that it works on.
  Windows Executable - This can be ran off of a flash drive and is simpler than the Windows Installer for those who know what they're doing on a computer.
  Android Package Kit (APK) - This can be installed on an Android device. Some errors will pop up as it is not from Google Play.
